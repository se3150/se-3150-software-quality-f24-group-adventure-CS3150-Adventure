Instructions:
    This is a text-based adventure game. You are trying to move from room to room gathering treasre, avoiding 
    traps and solving puzzles. You'll interact with the dungeon and its objects by issuing text commands.
    The default commands are:
        
    - move or go, accompanied by a direction (north, south, east, west, up, or down) to move to another location.
    - look <thing>: Describes the thing you are looking at. Just typing 'look' will describe the room.
    - get or take <object>: Puts the object into your inventory (if allowed).
    - drop <object>: Removes an item from your inventory.
    - inventory: Lists the objects you have in your inventory. You can 'look' at the objects for clues.
    - use <thing>: Uses objects in your inventory or sometimes in the room.
    - Custom commands: Try specific actions based on the room's features.
    - help: Lists available commands and visible exits.
    - hint: gives you a hint about what you could try in that specific room.
